Task Management Android App


Steps to Create the App

 Set up a new Android project

Open Android Studio.

Create a new Empty Activity project.

Name your project (e.g., TaskManagerApp), choose Java as the language, and set the minimum API level (e.g., API 21).


Design the Layout (XML)

We will use an EditText, Spinner, Button, and ListView.

Design the Layout.xml file--


 Create SQLite Database Helper (Java)

In Android, SQLite is used to store data. Create a TaskDatabaseHelper class that extends SQLiteOpenHelper.

TaskDatabaseHelper.java file--

Task Model Class
Define a model class Task to represent the tasks.

Task.java file--

MainActivity Code (Java)
This is where you write the core logic for your app to add, delete, and display tasks.

MainActivity.java file--

Usage
Task Entry:  Users can type a task and select a priority (Low, Medium, High). After clicking the Add Task button, the task is saved to the SQLite database and displayed in the ListView.

Viewing Tasks: The tasks are shown in a ListView with the format "Task Name (Priority)".
Delete Tasks: Long-pressing on a task in the list deletes it from both the UI and the database.

Persistent Storage: The SQLite database ensures that tasks persist across app restarts.
